# TaskRPG

TaskRPG is a CLI tool to be used alongside Habitica that takes the game and builds upon it by making more quests!

It's not yet complete and I will be working on this the next couple of days

I made this for myself, if you want to you can fork this and build upon it, I would be glad to see that!

# Dependencies

Lua 5.1 (yes it needs to be 5.1)

# How to use

Open a terminal on the directory where you extracted the TaskRPG and type

`lua5.1 main.lua`

and it should work, then you just type in what it wants you to

# Configuration

Currently there is no actual configuration but the idea is to have a

lua script that guides you through configuring TaskRPG!

# Credits

I got the idea for this project thanks to [Dragonrider](https://habitica.com/profile/9a542284-0568-429f-8baf-e4d8a807691b)

because they made this challenge [here](https://habitica.com/challenges/4561e435-bc9d-412a-affc-f7b7bf56db93)

and I thought it was pretty neat and I wanted to make a CLI tool to help me manage and build upon the idea!
